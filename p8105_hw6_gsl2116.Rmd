## P8105 Homework 6

### Problem 1
```{r homicide data}
# Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Modifiy victim_race to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

homicides = 
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race != "White", "Not White", "White")) %>% 
  transform(reported_date = as.Date(as.character(reported_date), "%Y%m%d"), 
            victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  select(uid, reported_date, city_state, everything()) %>% 
  select(-city, -state) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Tulsa, AL", "Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


```
